fMRI Summer School 2021, 28-30 June 2021, Leiden University

## Welcome

Welcome to the fMRI Summer School 2021! Below you will find all information necessary for the course. Including the links to the datasets used and any code. Throughout the two-day workshop we will mainly use the FMRIB Software Library (also known as FSL). FSL can be installed on any computer using Mac OS, Windows or Linux. In addition we will also be using R and RStudio for some advanced analyses.

## Installing FSL
FSL can be installed using the `fslinstaller.py` script. This script can be downloaded from the [FSL Website](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation), by clicking on **Download FSL**. Then proceed by clicking on the installation page of your operating system. FSL runs best on Linux / Mac OS, but runs also on newer versions of Windows (from Windows 10 and up). Please make sure when installing that there are no spaces in your installation directory name (stick to the defaults when possible).
