# fMRIsummerschool2021
fMRI Summer School 2021, 28-30 June 2021, Leiden University

## Welcome

Welcome to the fMRI Summer School 2021! Below you will find all information necessary for the course. Including the links to the datasets used and any code. Throughout the two-day workshop we will mainly use the FMRIB Software Library (also known as FSL). FSL can be installed on any computer using Mac OS, Windows or Linux. In addition, we will also be using R and RStudio for some advanced analyses.

## Software installation and data download
### Installing FSL
FSL can be installed using the `fslinstaller.py` script. This script can be downloaded from the [FSL Installation Website](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation), by clicking on **Download FSL**. Then proceed by clicking on the installation page of your operating system. FSL runs best on Linux / Mac OS, but runs also on newer versions of Windows (from Windows 10 and up). Please make sure when installing that there are no spaces in your installation directory name (stick to the defaults when possible).

### Installing R and RStudio
R is free to download from the [CRAN webiste](https://cran.r-project.org/). Click on **Download R for ...** and the version of your operating system. For Mac OS make sure you choose the package belonging to the version of your operating system (Big Sur and ARM processor models require a different version). Then download RStudio, an easier to use interface for R, from the [RStudio website](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), you need the free desktop edition.

### Downloading data
For the practicals we will use several subjects from a study by [Pernet et al. (2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811915005558). These data are available from [openneuro.org](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000158/versions/1.0.0) under accession number `ds000158`. We will only use the first 5 subjects from this dataset as to reduce computational load when doing the exercises. The data can be found via this link ([download dataset](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/ynIMQi5iQwRQvRb)). It requires a password that will be sent to you via e-mail.
